# Project Name: ML_Regression_Analysis
This project is a part of Supervised Machine Learning as well as my first Machine Learning project. I conducted this Regression Analysis on House Price data set. Both Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models are covered here.


## Supervised Machine Learning

The term 'Supervise' means to observe and direct the execution of a task, project or activity. In this type of Machine Learning the Client( The coder or data Scientist) supervise the model by teaching so that it can predict unknown or future instances. We teach the model by using training data. One thing to remember that the training data must be labeled. In this case, column names are called attributes, columns are called features.

## Regression

It is a supervised Machine Learning process of predicting continuous value (called as response or target, denoted by **Y**) using one or more continuous or categorical independent values (called as predictors or features, denoted by **X**). There are two types of Regression approaches. Simple Regression(Linear or Non-linear) and Multiple Regression(Linear or Non-linear).   Now let us consider an example. Suppose, we have a data set that contains house prices of 10 houses. First 9 house prices are given and they have a relation with the other attributes of the data set. By Regression Analysis, we can easily estimate the price of the last house by building a model.

## Regression Algorithms

To perform this Regression Analysis , there are many algorithms we can follow. They are all good algorithms, but all of them are not used in real life applications. The algorithms are - 
1. Ordinal Regression Analysis
2. Poisson Regression
3. Fast Forest Quantile Regression
4. Linear, polynomial, Lasso, Stepwise, Ridge Regularization
5. Bayesian Linear Regression
6. Neural Network Regression
7. Decision Forest Regression
8. Boosted Decision Tree Regression
10. KNN or K-Nearest Neighbours


## About the SaratogaHouses Data set

The data set is also attached in the file section of this project. This data set is easily available in GitHub as well as in Kaggle. This data set named **SaratogaHouses** has 1728 rows/observations and 16 columns/features/attributes/values. Generally the **price** column is considered as the **Response Variable**. The other columns can be considered as predictor variables. Observe that column **price** is a continuous column and other column are of mixed type. 

## Project Stages

Here I gone through some steps or stages to complete this project. In this project I build both Simple and Multiple Linaer Regression Model using the **sklearn** library and it's different modules. Here are detailed stages of this project.

**1. Basic Data Exploration:**

In this step,
